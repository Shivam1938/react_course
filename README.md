# 🚀 React Learning Journey

Welcome to my React learning repository! This space documents my daily progress as I work toward mastering React—from the basics to advanced concepts—with a focus on building, experimenting, and sharing.

## 📅 Daily Commitment

Every day, I aim to:
- Learn a new React concept or deepen my understanding of an existing one
- Build something practical—whether it’s a small component or a mini-project
- Document my progress clearly for others and for future reference

## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to complete React as efficiently as possible, without rushing through the fundamentals. I’m focused on real understanding, hands-on practice, and building projects that reflect what I’ve learned.

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

- **`README.md`** – This file. It outlines my learning journey, goals, and structure.
- **`src/`** – Daily builds, practice components, and mini-projects. Each folder reflects a concept I’ve explored (e.g. `useState`, `props`, `customHooks`).
- **`assets/`** – Static resources like images, icons, or design elements used across projects.

## 🧠 Topics I’ll Cover

- JSX, props, and state
- Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks
- Component architecture and modular design
- Routing, context API, and performance optimization
- Real-world scaffolding with Vite + Tailwind

## 📌 Why This Repo?

This isn’t just a sandbox—it’s a public log of my growth. I’ll be sharing updates on GitHub and LinkedIn to connect with other devs, showcase progress, and stay accountable.
